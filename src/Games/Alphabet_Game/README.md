- The project features a user interface that displays all the alphabets from A to Z, accompanied by corresponding images. When a child clicks on a specific alphabet or types a single alphabet, a corresponding sound is played. For example, if the child clicks on the letter 'A', a sound saying "A for apple" will be played.

- The purpose of this project is to provide a fun and educational tool for children to learn and familiarize themselves with the alphabet. By associating each letter with a visual representation and an auditory cue, it aims to enhance their understanding and retention of the alphabet.
